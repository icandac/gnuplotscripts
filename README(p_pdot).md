Except one thing, this is a very common gnuplot script and there is no need to any exeggerate description. 
The line at the top of the file "set term tikz standalone color size 5in,5in" makes tkiz ruled in. 
Tikz is a terminal which helps you to make graphs embedded into a latex file with gnuplot. 
You can use this feature just with an extra line, without using the line above it with a # before, and a 
".tex" output command, not a ".ps" one. And one exceptional file that bringss them all: "gnuplot-lua-tikz.sty"
You can download it from ctan, i guess, as the other packages. tikz terminal was not a very common thing that 
have many many enrties in forums and other stuff when i was trying to learn it nearly 6. months ago, so you 
can ask any questions about it from here and i may try to help you, if i can do it.
